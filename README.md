# IOT-enabled-Metronome-with-ARM-Mbed
A metronome is a device that creates a visual or audible pulse at consistent intervals. Depending on the BPM we carry out different tasks through RESTful API

ARM mbed and the FRDMK64F allow one to easily program a microcontroller while simultaneously preparing the device for the Internet of Things.

Here I have created a metronome using the buttons and LEDs on the FRDM board.
Then I created a web interface to interact with the device remotely.
